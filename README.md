Simple HTTP Server written in java using ServerSocket.
ServerSocket implements a socket that servers can use to listen for and accept connections to clients. A ServerSocket object establishes the port where a server waits for connections from clients. 

Compile and run using command line arguments. 

Once run, HTTP server will listen on port 8080 accepting connections and reading requests, and sends response. In this demo, response sent to client is current date, and it will display in browser on http://localhost:8080.
